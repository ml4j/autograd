     * and context compatibility follow the concrete numerical type's rules.

     * with no inputs) accumulate across passes; intermediate gradients are replaced.
     * Constants receive no contributions from the pass. Reset leaf gradient nodes
     * explicitly to discard previous contributions.

     * <p>Gradient computations retain differentiable dependencies for higher derivatives;
     * constant derivative expressions need not require gradients themselves. Gradient
     * value identity is not guaranteed, while gradient-node identity remains stable.

     * <p>The original graph remains available for another pass: backward does not
     * release its inputs, callbacks, or numerical suppliers. This serves the purpose
     * of {@code keepGraph}/{@code retainGraph}, independently of derivative recording.
     * Resetting a gradient node clears its held reference, not forward graph state
     * or previously returned expressions. Unreachable objects can still be garbage
     * collected. These policies do not change lazy forward evaluation.
