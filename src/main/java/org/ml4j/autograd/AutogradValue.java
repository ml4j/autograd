/**
 * Connects numerical data to its computation node and accumulated gradient state.
 *
 * <p>A scalar addition result or tensor operation result has a value node describing
 * its inputs. Its gradient node holds contributions produced by differentiation.
 * A gradient can itself be an autograd value with its own computation graph,
 * allowing gradient expressions to be differentiated for higher derivatives.
 * For example, the gradient of a scalar cube can be differentiated again; tensor
 * operation rules can support Hessian-vector products in the same way.
 *
 * <p>Backward currently records differentiable gradient computations (broadly
 * equivalent to {@code createGraph = true}) and preserves the original graph for
 * reuse (the purpose of {@code keepGraph}, also called {@code retainGraph}). There
 * are no configuration flags for either policy. Constant derivatives need not
 * require gradients; higher-derivative support depends on the operation rules.
 *
 * <p>These policies may be revisited for first-order training without derivative
 * graphs, tensor memory pressure, explicit release of saved backward buffers, or
 * operations with limited higher-derivative support. Such configuration requires
 * a separately agreed contract; it is not provided by this interface today.
 *
 * <p>This value coordinates graph-wide backward passes. Value nodes execute local
 * rules; gradient nodes store contributions. Addition follows the non-mutating
 * {@link Accumulatable} contract, retaining dependencies on the result.
 *
 * @param <V> the concrete autograd value type, also used to represent gradients
 * @param <D> the numerical data type, such as Float or a tensor implementation
 * @param <C> the context type, such as shape/size or Void when no metadata is needed
