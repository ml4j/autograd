# Specification

## Purpose

Build a small Java automatic differentiation library incrementally, starting with
scalar examples and explicit, documented interface contracts.
Keep contracts adaptable to matrices and tensors; scalar examples are the initial
validation scope, not a restriction on numerical data types.

## Constraints

- The repository builds independently using Java 25 and its Maven Wrapper.
- No dependency on legacy code or sibling projects.
- Each unit has one clear responsibility. Implementations have tests demonstrating
  their contracts, including relevant boundary cases.

## Current state

The repository contains standalone build infrastructure, the documented `Value` and
`ValueNode` interfaces, and the immutable scalar implementation `FloatValue` with tests.
No computation-node implementation has been introduced yet.

## Interface decisions and change control

### Javadoc convention

Start type and method Javadoc with short, plain-language statements explaining
the purpose or behaviour. Follow with simple examples where useful, including
scalar and tensor examples when relevant. Present the precise contract details
after this introduction: guarantees, constraints, nullability, identity, lifecycle,
and failure behaviour. Finish with the applicable parameter, return, and exception tags.

The introduction and examples must agree with the detailed contract. Keep examples
illustrative; do not imply dependencies or functionality that the contract does not provide.

### Contract changes

Record the agreed decisions for each new interface here when it is introduced:
its purpose, responsibilities, method signatures, observable behaviour, and relevant
constraints. Distinguish agreed contracts from unresolved questions.

Established interface contracts must not change without the user's explicit agreement.
This includes signatures and semantics, such as mutation, identity, nullability,
lifecycle, and failure behaviour. Propose the reason and impact of a change before
implementing it, then update this specification, Javadoc, and affected tests together
after agreement. Refactoring an implementation must preserve the agreed contract.

## Agreed interface: `org.ml4j.autograd.Value<D, C>`

Purpose: provide numerical data access and the metadata needed to interpret that data.
`D` describes the numerical data type; `C` describes its context type.
For example, `D` can be a tensor implementation type and `C` a shape or size type
describing its dimensions. These examples introduce no tensor-library dependency.

```java
Supplier<D> data();
C context();
```

- `data()` returns a non-null supplier without evaluating numerical data. Successful
  supplier evaluations return non-null data; null does not represent absence.
- Numerical contents and context remain stable throughout the value's lifetime.
  A lazy supplier must represent the same contents on repeated evaluations, rather
  than a changing source. Context must remain compatible with the numerical data.
- Stability is semantic, not an object-identity guarantee. Implementations and callers
  must not mutate exposed data or context objects in ways that change the represented value.
- Caching is an implementation choice. Neither supplier nor result/context object
  identity is guaranteed. Evaluation failures may propagate from the supplier;
  this interface defines no recovery policy or particular evaluation exception type.
- `context()` does not evaluate numerical data. It may return null only when no
  additional metadata is needed; `Void` is the intended context type for such values.
- The contract provides no mutation, cache invalidation, gradient, graph, or naming operations.

## Implementation: `org.ml4j.autograd.scalar.FloatValue`

- A final class implementing `Value<Float, Void>`, constructed with a primitive float.
- Stores fixed scalar data; its supplier returns that data without a mutation API.
- Uses null context because the scalar needs no additional metadata.
- Accepts all primitive float values, including signed zero, infinities, and NaN.
- Tests demonstrate stable repeated data access, independent values, absent context,
  and preservation of floating-point boundary values.

## Agreed interface: `org.ml4j.autograd.node.ValueNode<V>`

Purpose: represent a forward value, its immediate computation dependencies, and its
local backward callback. The type bound is `V extends Value<?, ?>`; no gradient
interface or implementation is required by this contract.

```java
V value();
List<? extends ValueNode<?>> inputs();
void setBackwardFunction(Consumer<V> resultValueBackwardFunction);
Consumer<V> backwardFunction();
void backward();
```

- `value()` returns a non-null represented value without evaluating numerical data.
- `inputs()` returns an unmodifiable, non-null list of non-null nodes in operand order.
  Leaves have no inputs. Duplicate operand references are preserved. Inputs may use
  different numerical data and context types.
- The callback consumes the represented forward/result value, not its gradient.
  Gradient lookup and contribution calculation are responsibilities of the callback.
- Installing a callback replaces the previous one without executing either callback.
  Passing null removes it. `backwardFunction()` returns the installed callback or null,
  without executing it or evaluating data.
- `backward()` invokes the installed callback once with `value()`, or does nothing
  when no callback exists. It does not traverse inputs, seed gradients, or extract
  gradients. A separate coordinator ensures contributions are ready before invocation.
- Callback exceptions propagate; this local operation offers no rollback guarantee.
- Scalar and tensor operations use the same node contract; context such as tensor
  shape remains on the represented value.

## Decisions still to finalise

Review and document gradient accumulation,
reset, and backward-pass behaviour as their interfaces are introduced. Earlier
proof-of-concept designs are candidates to evaluate, not requirements to copy wholesale.
